📊 Social Media Engagement Analysis – Data Visualization (R Studio)
📌 Overview

This project analyzes social media engagement patterns across different platforms and post types using R Studio. The goal is to understand how user interactions such as likes, shares, comments, and engagement scores vary based on platform and content type through effective data visualization.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains social media interaction data with the following attributes:

Platform – Facebook, Instagram, Twitter

Post Type – Image, Text, Video

Likes – Total number of likes

Shares – Total number of shares

Comments – Total number of comments

Engagement Score – Overall engagement metric

📈 Visualizations & Key Insights
1️⃣ Average Engagement Score by Platform and Post Type

(Bar Chart using ggplot2)

Compares average engagement across platforms and post types

Instagram shows higher engagement for Image and Video posts

Twitter performs better with Text posts

Facebook shows consistent but moderate engagement

2️⃣ Density of Likes vs Shares

(Hex Bin Plot)

Displays density of likes and shares to identify engagement clusters

Higher likes generally correspond to higher shares

Hex binning helps reduce overplotting and improves clarity

3️⃣ Engagement Score by Post Type

(Jitter Plot)

Shows variation in engagement scores for different post types

Image posts tend to receive higher engagement

Video posts show wider variation across platforms

Jittering prevents overlapping of data points

4️⃣ Likes vs Comments by Platform

(Scatter Plot with Alpha Blending)

Visualizes relationship between likes and comments

Positive correlation observed across platforms

Alpha blending highlights dense interaction regions

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Software: R Studio

Programming Language: R

Libraries Used:

ggplot2 – Data visualization

dplyr – Data manipulation

tidyr – Data cleaning

🎯 Conclusion

Using R Studio and ggplot2, this project effectively visualizes and compares engagement metrics across social media platforms. The analysis provides valuable insights into content performance and can help in making data-driven decisions for social media strategies.
