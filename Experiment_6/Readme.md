# 🛍️ Advanced Multivariate Displays – Retail Analytics

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **advanced multivariate visualization techniques** in **R Studio** to analyze retail data and understand patterns related to **sales, profit, discounts, regions, and customer segments**.

---

## Objective
To apply advanced multivariate display techniques for analyzing retail analytics data and uncovering meaningful patterns across multiple variables.

---

## Scenario
A retail analytics team analyzes sales data to understand relationships between **sales, profit, discounts, regions, and customer segments** in order to support business decision-making.

---

## Tool & Language Used
- **R Studio**
- **R Programming Language**

---

## Libraries Used
- `GGally`
- `ggplot2`
- `lattice`

---

## Dataset Description
The retail dataset contains attributes such as:
- Sales  
- Profit  
- Discount  
- Region  
- Customer_Segment  

---

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Parallel Coordinate Plot
A **parallel coordinate plot** was created to visualize multiple numerical variables (Sales, Profit, Discount) simultaneously and compare patterns across different regions.

**Purpose:**  
To identify trends and variations in performance metrics across regions.

---

### 2. Bubble Chart
A **bubble chart** was generated to analyze the relationship between **Sales and Profit**, where:
- Bubble size represents Sales volume  
- Color represents Customer Segment  

**Purpose:**  
To highlight high-performing customer segments and sales–profit relationships.

---

### 3. Trellis Display by Region
A **trellis (faceted) scatter plot** was created using lattice to display **Sales vs Profit** separately for each region.

**Purpose:**  
To compare regional sales and profit patterns effectively.

---

## Key Highlights
- Multivariate data comparison using parallel coordinates  
- Visual encoding using size and color  
- Region-wise comparison using trellis display  
- Clear and interpretable visualizations  

---

## Result
The visualizations reveal meaningful patterns in retail performance, including regional variations and customer segment differences in sales and profit.

---

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates how **advanced multivariate visualization techniques in R** can be effectively used to explore complex retail datasets and support data-driven business decisions.
