🚦 Visual Encoding for Traffic Accident Analysis using R
Objective

To apply effective visual encoding principles for meaningful data communication using graphical representations.

Scenario

A city traffic department analyzes accident data to identify high-risk zones and accident severity patterns. Visual analytics is used to support traffic safety planning and decision-making.

Tool Used

R Studio

R Programming Language

Dataset Description

The dataset contains traffic accident records with attributes such as:

Accident location / zone

Accident severity

Accident frequency

Accident type

In-Lab Tasks Performed
1. Severity Encoding using Color Gradients

Accident severity levels were encoded using color gradients, where different colors represent varying degrees of severity.
This enables quick identification of high-severity accident zones.

2. Accident Frequency Representation using Size

Accident frequency was represented using variable marker sizes.
Larger sizes indicate higher accident frequency, helping highlight high-risk areas visually.

3. Accident Type Representation using Shape

Different shapes were used to represent accident types.
This allows multiple accident categories to be distinguished clearly within the same visualization.

Key Visualization Principles Applied

Color for severity differentiation

Size for frequency comparison

Shape for categorical distinction

Minimal and clear visual design

Result

The visual encodings effectively highlight high-risk zones, severity patterns, and accident types, making complex accident data easy to interpret at a glance.

Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how visual encoding techniques in R enhance data communication and support informed decision-making in traffic safety analysis.
