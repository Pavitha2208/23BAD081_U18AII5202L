📊 Designing Multivariate Patterns using R Objective

To discover relationships among multiple variables using multivariate visualization techniques in R.

Scenario

A hospital analytics team studies patient health records to identify relationships between Age, BMI, Glucose Levels, and Blood Pressure for early disease prediction and better healthcare decision-making.

Tool Used

R Studio

R Programming Language

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of patient health indicators, including:

Age

BMI

Glucose_Level

Blood_Pressure

In-Lab Tasks Performed

Scatter Plot Matrix
A scatter plot matrix was generated to visualize pairwise relationships among multiple health variables. This helps in identifying overall trends, patterns, and possible correlations between variables.

Color Encoding for Age Groups
Patients were grouped into different age categories, and color encoding was applied to visualize the relationship between Age and BMI. This improves interpretability by clearly distinguishing age-based patterns.

Identification of Correlated Health Indicators
Scatter plots with trend lines were created to analyze correlations between:

BMI and Glucose Level

Age and Blood Pressure

These visualizations help identify variables that show positive or negative relationships.

Result

The multivariate visualizations revealed meaningful relationships among health indicators. Moderate correlations were observed between certain variables, supporting early identification of health risks.

Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how multivariate visualization in R can effectively uncover relationships among multiple health variables and assist in data-driven healthcare analysis.
