# 🎓 Student Performance Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves the design and development of an **interactive analytical dashboard** using **Power BI** to monitor student attendance and academic performance in a smart campus environment.

---

## Objective
To design an interactive dashboard for monitoring **key academic metrics** such as attendance and performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.

---

## Scenario
An AI-based smart campus system requires real-time monitoring of student performance across different **departments**, **semesters**, and **subjects** to support academic planning and intervention.

---

## Tool Used
- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains student academic information with the following fields:
- Student_ID  
- Department  
- Semester  
- Subject  
- Attendance_Percentage  
- Assignment_Marks  
- Internal_Test1  
- Internal_Test2  
- Final_Grade

### 2. Filters (Slicers)
- **Department-wise filter**
- **Semester-wise filter**
- Filters are linked across all visuals for interactive analysis

---

### 3. Drill-Down Analysis
- Attendance analyzed at **Department level**
- Drill-down enabled to view **Subject-wise attendance**
- Context preserved during drill-down interactions

---

## Key Highlights
- Interactive and user-friendly dashboard
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Linked visuals using slicers and drill-down
- Clean design to avoid information overload

---

## Result
The dashboard provides clear insights into attendance and academic performance, helping stakeholders identify trends, compare departments, and monitor subject-level performance efficiently.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Power BI** can be used to build an effective student performance monitoring dashboard using KPI cards, filters, and drill-down analysis for smart campus applications.
